AI has not yet reached the stage to predict the stock prices correctly since AI analyzes and predicts with respect to the past data but we can never rely on past data when it comes to trading. When it comes to trading, past performances are not indicative of future results.

The buy-low, sell-high myth also fails since whatever we assume to be low at this time, the price of the stock might go down even further and when it rises, the new rise may not be even equal to the price at which we bought the stock in the first place assuming the price of the stock at that time to be low.

The only input we are giving the AI to predict is the price history but what we need to take care is that there is a lot of information about the underlying factors that affect the price of the stock. Price is the consequence of everything that is happening on the market, not the cause.

ML is here to enhance our ability to perceive patterns that have proven successful in the past. We need to set the game as a winnable game by taking advantage of demonstrated correlations.

We can compare this situation with 5 stages of self driving cars. Right now, while creating this project about algorithmic trading, we might be at most at level 2. For more clarifications, the image : https://hackernoon.com/hn-images/0*6_8abTMVP1jOPxs3.
